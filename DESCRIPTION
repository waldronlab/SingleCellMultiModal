Description: SingleCellMultiModal is an ExperimentHub package
    that serves multiple datasets obtained from GEO and other sources and
    represents them as MultiAssayExperiment objects. We provide several
    multi-modal datasets including scNMT, 10X Multiome, seqFISH, CITEseq,
    SCoPE2, and others. The scope of the package is is to provide data for
    benchmarking and analysis.
