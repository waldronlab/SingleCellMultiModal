\usage{
.CITEseqMaeToSce(mae)
}
\arguments{
\item{mae}{a MultiAssayExperiment object with scRNA and/or scADT and/or
scHTO named experiments.}
}
\value{
a SingleCellExperiment object as widely with scRNA data as counts
and scADT, scHTO data as altExps.
If only one modality is present, it has returned as main assay of the SCE.
}
\description{
converts a `MultiAssayExperiment` object with CITEseq data into
a `SingleCellExperiment` object to be used with already known methods and
packages in literature.

Note that for creating a `SingleCellExperiment` object the following function
subsets all the assays present in the `MultiAssayExperiment` with only the
common cells across all the modalities.
This could result in a not complete object.
